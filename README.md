Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) presents challenges in early detection and intervention, 
prompting novel diagnostic approaches. This study employs machine learning and deep 
learning on eye-tracking data to uncover ASD-related patterns. Utilizing traditional
algorithms and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), we analyze longitudinal eyetracking biomarker datasets. Logistic Regression, KNN, SVC, Decision Tree, and 
Random Forest algorithms are trained and evaluated alongside CNN models.
Results demonstrate efficacy in discerning ASD-related patterns, with SVC and Random 
Forest showing robust generalization. Integration of an augmented CNN model into the 
"TAYF" desktop application marks progress towards clinical deployment, offering 
clinicians a tool for early ASD detection. This research highlights the potential of 
computational methods to enhance understanding and intervention for ASD-related 
visual processing abnormalities, aiming to improve outcomes for individuals on the 
autism spectrum.
